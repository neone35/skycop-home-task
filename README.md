## Task

You have to create a simple React/React-Redux App that "fetches" a response into Redux state,
displays a dropdown with the results, and upon changing a selection, it's value (not title)
has to be displayed somewhere.

Criteria:

* On button click the data is "fetched"
* Dropdown has to be displayed from redux state
* On change, the value has to be shown somewhere

P.S. You can use default bootstrap styles if you wish.
